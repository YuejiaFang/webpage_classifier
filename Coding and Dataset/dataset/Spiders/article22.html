But there is one saving grace: at least spiders are solitary, so they are usually encountered in small numbers.</p><p>That's certainly what I thought.</p><p>But then I found myself trudging along a muddy path in the Peruvian Amazon jungle, face to face with a spider colony several thousand strong. Their funnel-shaped web arched from tree to tree, a structure containing too many of the creepy crawlies to count.</p><p>These were spiders but not as I knew them: they appeared to function as a society, just like ants or bees.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p04f2kr9\"}}</p><p>Most spiders are indeed lone wolves, but a scant handful have evolved a level of sociality to rival ant colonies, bee hives, or even primate societies.</p><blockquote><p> Communal spiders work together to build, maintain, and clean their webs </p></blockquote><p><em>Anelosimus eximius</em>, the species I encountered in the rainforest, is not the only kind of social spider in the world, but it does construct the biggest webs. Some can reach more than 25ft (7.6m) feet long and 5ft (1.5m) wide. A web that size could contain as many as 50,000 individual spiders. That is a lot of legs, eyes and fangs.</p><p><em>A. eximius</em> was first discovered more than a century ago by a French arachnologist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Simon\">Eug&egrave;ne Simon</a>. More social spiders have been discovered since. One was found as recently as 2006, in Ecuador, by entomologist <a href=\"http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/person/laviles\">Leticia Avil&eacute;s</a>.</p><p>Sociality shows up in at least seven spider families. In all we know of around 25 social species among the 45,000 described spider species on the planet. Sociality evolved at least a dozen separate times among them.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4n99\"}}</p><p>While the details vary from species to species among the social spiders, many of their features are similar.</p><p>For example, an <em>A. eximius</em> colony contains adult males and females as well as youngsters, but the majority of spiders on the web are females. In the early 1980s, researchers found that males comprise only between 5% and 22% of any colony's populace.</p><p>Communal spiders <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3705391\">work together</a> to build, maintain, and clean their webs. They cooperate in capturing prey, and dine together when they snare a large feast.</p><p>The females feed their offspring by vomiting up food for them, just like mother birds. They even regurgitate food for juveniles other than their own. In other words, they work together to care for the youngest in the colony. It is a sort of spider day-care.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4nv4\"}}</p><p>Nearby colonies tend to be related to each other, because new colonies form in one of two ways.</p><p>Sometimes, a large web is broken in half, perhaps by heavy rainfall or falling branches, or even a falling monkey. In its place, two smaller colonies are left behind.</p><blockquote><p> My students know more about social spiders than your average arachnologist </p></blockquote><p>Other times, individual females will strike out on their own, setting up a new web. Eventually other dispersing females will join the group; perhaps ones who tried to set up their own webs but failed. Survival is more likely in groups, after all.</p><p>These two processes together help to explain why <em>A. eximius</em> colonies tend to be found in clusters, sometimes as many as 40 related colonies within just a few kilometres.</p><p><em>A. eximius</em> is perhaps the best known of the social spiders, but that is not saying much.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4njg\"}}</p><p>Gregarious arachnids are not much studied &ndash; perhaps because so few of them exist in the first place. \"My students know more about social spiders than your average arachnologist,\" says <a href=\"https://entomology.cals.cornell.edu/people/linda-rayor\">Linda Rayor</a>, an entomologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who studies Australia's <a href=\"http://australianmuseum.net.au/huntsman-spiders\">social huntsman spiders</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Why was the bee subject to such an awful fate? </p></blockquote><p>\"Most animals are solitary,\" she tells me, \"whether you're looking at mammals, or birds, or whatever. Social behaviour in otherwise solitary animals is cool.\"</p><p>Cool indeed, if somewhat creepy.</p><p>As I watched the social spiders go about their day deep in the jungle, a bee found itself stuck in the giant web. Suddenly, dozens of the eight-legged predators descended <em>en masse</em> onto the struggling black-and-yellow striped insect. It was impossible to see through the writhing mass of tiny spider legs, but one thing was certain: that bee was done for.</p><p>If death by one spider seems bad enough, it must be nothing compared to an attack by a whole swarm of them.</p><p>Why was the bee subject to such an awful fate? Or, to put it another way, how and why did a few spiders become social when the overwhelming majority of their fellow species are solitary?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4ncz\"}}</p><p>The first spider, the proto-spider, was probably solitary. So the spiders that gave rise to today's truly social species must have been too. But then they did something remarkable: they turned sub-social: they learned to tolerate each other, at least for a time &ndash; even if they did not exactly enjoy hanging out in groups.</p><blockquote><p> As they mature, they become intolerant of each other </p></blockquote><p>That early tolerance could have come about as a result of parental care. In some spiders alive today, that is just defending an egg sac, but in others &ndash; the ones that are poised to evolve sociality &ndash; it looks more familiar to our mammal brains.</p><p>In those species, females provide food and protection for their developing offspring, and occasionally even to other juveniles. In some species, mothers even make the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.3699\">ultimate sacrifice</a>, allowing themselves in their last moments to become a meal for their brood. Sub-social spiders can still be cannibals, after all.</p><p>\"They're the spiders that already have cooperation as juveniles,\" says arachnologist Jonathan Pruitt of the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"But as they mature, they become intolerant of each other.\"</p><p>In other words, juvenile tolerance alone is not enough to turn spiders fully social. The environment in which the spiders live also has to be right. Researchers have discovered three ecological elements that often lead to cooperative living among arachnids.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4m5x\"}}</p><p>Social spiders tend to feed on bigger prey, for one thing.</p><p>Solitary spiders living in places where it is difficult to subdue large or more profitable prey alone may eventually figure out that it is in their interest to work together. It is a smaller step from tolerance to cooperation than from aggression to cooperation.</p><blockquote><p> Social spiders just about always build webs </p></blockquote><p>Another common feature is heavy rain. Rain does not have to be frequent, but when it is really intense, it has the potential to seriously damage spider webs. When a tempest takes out the web and threatens a spider's survival, the ones with just a glimmer of social behaviour might fare just a little better than their isolationist peers.</p><p>As a result, some have hypothesised that rough weather favours cooperation, since in those conditions it is the spiders that share the task of maintaining and repairing their webs that fare best. \"Many hands make light work of web repair,\" says Pruitt.</p><p>Then there is the web itself. There are only a couple of instances in which spiders that do not build webs have evolved to be sub-social. These web-less social spiders, living in places like the Australian deserts or in African scrub habitat, have to cope with unusual circumstances &ndash; like enormous prey or particularly aggressive raiding ants.</p><p>But these cases aside, social spiders just about always build webs. And most of these webs have complex, three-dimensional structures, like the cone-shaped <em>A. eximius </em>webs I encountered in the jungle.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4m38\"}}</p><p>Pruitt thinks that could be a simple matter of mechanics. It is easier for two spiders just on the cusp of evolving sociality to join their webs together if they exist in three dimensions than if they weave flatter, two-dimensional ones, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_spider\">Charlotte's eponymous web</a>.</p><p>Some combination of tolerance, prey size, rough weather, and web geometry combine to create the perfect storm for social behaviour to emerge in spiders.</p><blockquote><p> Anyone can do any job, and all are capable of reproduction </p></blockquote><p>Add in the fact that it is easier to defend yourself against predators in a group, and that communal webs offer spiders the relative safety of staying in one place rather than risking travelling away from the web onto which you are born to live somewhere else, and for some species, cooperation is a good deal.</p><p>These spiders, like <em>A. eximius </em>with its massive funnel pits of doom, may superficially seem to behave like social insects. But in truth they could hardly be more different.</p><p>Bees and ants sort into separate castes. Some are workers, some are soldiers (or drones), and then there is a reproductive class. Those not included in the reproductive class are sterile; they could not reproduce even if they wanted to.</p><p>Social spiders, meanwhile, are more egalitarian. Anyone can do any job, and all are capable of reproduction.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4mpl\"}}</p><p>It is not that spider societies do not rely on the division of labour. It is just that those roles are not strictly governed as they are for the social insects.</p><blockquote><p> Spider vocations are intimately tied to their efficiency at those vocations </p></blockquote><p>And while some female social spiders do not wind up reproducing, it is not because they are physically or genetically incapable. Instead, it is usually just because they have not lived successful enough lives. It takes a lot of nutrition to make a few hundred spider babies, and a spider that does not have a rich enough diet is not really up to the task.</p><p>Instead, roles in spider colonies are usually sorted on the basis of age and sex. Researchers are increasingly coming to realise that social spiders also sort themselves according to their individual personalities. \"They're incredibly well organised,\" says Pruitt.</p><p>By paying close attention to individual spiders, he and others have discovered that certain spiders are more likely to spend their days attacking predators, while others are more likely to repair the webs, help keep parasites away, clean the web, rear the young, and so on.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4mwg\"}}</p><p>\"Spider vocations are intimately tied to their efficiency at those vocations,\" he says.</p><blockquote><p> In spite of a lack of genetic diversity, they exhibit this exquisite diversity in terms of their personalities </p></blockquote><p>Though it is not yet clear whether those skills develop through experience or because of innate aptitude, some spiders are clearly in the construction business, some are hunters, others are on janitorial duty, and still others offer childcare services.</p><p>In species like <em>A. eximius</em>, spiders are essentially clones. Brothers and sisters mate with each other, generation after generation, so that colonies become highly inbred.</p><p>Since adolescent spiders do not go off in search of new colonies, there is no influx of new genetic material. For that reason, some suspect that spider personalities develop as a result of early life experiences, not genetics. \"In spite of a lack of genetic diversity, they exhibit this exquisite diversity in terms of their personalities,\" Pruitt says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03g4lxr\"}}</p><p>In 2013, he and his colleagues looked at a social spider called <em>Stegodyphus sarasinorum</em>, native to India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. They <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.1407\">found that</a> individual personality traits predict which job each spider performs.</p><p><em>S. sarasinorum</em> is found in dry scrubland.

you do not suffer from arachnophobia, you might well admire the intricate webs that spiders weave to catch their meals. But one species spins a web more impressive than any other. This web spans several metres and is spun in silk tougher than Kevlar.</p><p>Spider webs come in all shapes and sizes. Different spiders favour funnels, sheets, tubes or a tangle of lines to rival any <em>Mission Impossible</em> laser maze. But if asked to draw the classic spider web, most of us would sketch an orb web.</p><blockquote><p> Its conspicuous webs can reach over 40cm in diameter </p></blockquote><p>This is the name given to webs with a spiralling, circular pattern of interconnecting threads. Within an orb web, there are different types of silk: the strong scaffolding lines provide structure and the sticky capture threads trap prey.</p><p>It is not surprising that orb webs are the most familiar to us, as a lot of spiders make them. That includes most of the nearly 3000 members of the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/8819/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Araneidae</a> family, commonly known as the orb weavers and the third largest spider family on the planet.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396nby\"}}</p><p>In the northern hemisphere, some of the most regularly encountered webs belong to the European <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1194185/overview\" target=\"_blank\">garden cross spider</a>. The species is named, not for its temperament, but for the white cross marking on its bulbous abdomen.</p><blockquote><p> The largest webs in Australia belong to golden orb weavers of the Nephila genus </p></blockquote><p>Its conspicuous webs can reach over 40cm in diameter. The spiders weave them at night, ready for a day of catching common garden insects like flies, wasps and butterflies.</p><p>They are particularly noticeable in the autumn, when the verdant foliage of summer dies back. The new generation of spiders mature in this season. Dew highlights the silken lines of their woven constructions, which often hang between shrubs or over doorways.</p><p>In warmer regions of the world, both the spiders and webs can be bigger.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396n8z\"}}</p><p>The largest webs in Australia belong to golden orb weavers of the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/89187/overview\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nephila</em></a> genus, named for the golden appearance of their silk. These webs can reach up to 1m in diameter and hang between trees or sign posts.</p><p>The spiders themselves can span a human hand with their legs. Their webs are very strong and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/3353693/Giant-spider-eating-a-bird-caught-on-camera.html\">there are records of particularly large spiders feeding on birds that become entangled in them</a>.</p><blockquote><p> The female sprays a continuous line of silk from one bank of the river </p></blockquote><p>The <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007516\">largest golden orb weaver hit the headlines in 2009 when scientists formally introduced it to the public</a>. The body of a female <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/11599445/overview\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nephila komaci </em></a>can be up to 4cm long, with legs more than 10cm long. They weave giant webs that can reach more than 1m in diameter.</p><p>The species is very rare: it has only been found in two locations in Madagascar and Maputaland, southern Africa.</p><p>Then in 2010, an international team of biologists announced that they had found <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1636/B09-113.1\">the world's largest spider webs, also in Madagascar</a>. The species responsible was officially described on the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, so it was named <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/17896869/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Darwin's bark spider</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396n81\"}}</p><p>It is hard to understand why nobody noticed these spiders before. A single web can span a river 25m wide.</p><p>To build it, the female sprays a continuous line of silk from one bank of the river. Air currents carry it across to the other side to create a bridge. In the centre of this bridge, the spider constructs a spiralling orb web that can reach almost 3m in diameter.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396ndg\"}}</p><p>You might expect the creator of this colossal web to have the proportions of a fictional giant, but Darwin's bark spider is no Shelob.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396ncq\"}}</p><p>\"<em>C. darwini</em> females measure about 1.5 cm in body size, and weigh about 0.5 gram, while males are much smaller, weighing 10 times less,\" says&nbsp;Matjaž Gregorič of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana, who has been researching the spiders since their discovery. They are also camouflaged to match tree bark.</p><p>How and why would such small spiders produce the huge quantities of silk needed for their supersize webs?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396nbk\"}}</p><p>\"Why their webs are so big is a good question and we don't have a definite answer yet,\" says Gregorič.</p><blockquote><p> No other spider utilizes the air column above open water </p></blockquote><p>To find out, he and his colleagues have been researching <a href=\"http://dx.doi.orgi/10.1111/zoj.12281\">evolutionary relationships between spiders, which should shed some light on how web weaving evolved</a>.</p><p>\"The whole genus <em>Caerostris</em> seems to have silk tougher than other spiders, and a bit of a unique web building behaviour,\" he says. While <em>Nephila </em>spiders weave webs with dense patterns of lower quality silk, <em>Caerostris</em> create sparse webs with very tough silk.</p><p>Both techniques provide a strong web that can catch prey. But by positioning their webs directly above rivers, Darwin's bark spiders can capture dozens of dragonflies, mayflies and other energy-rich insects that live over the water.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396n7n\"}}</p><p>\"We hypothesize that this combination was a predisposition for the spider to being able to conquer the unique habitat. No other spider utilizes the air column above open water, so probably, web size and material properties went hand in hand with habitat adaptation,\" says Gregorič.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396nb9\"}}</p><p>To find out if this idea is correct, biologists are studying the spiders and their silk. To test the properties of the silk they use a tensile testing machine, which&nbsp;Gregorič describes as: \"a machine that grabs a thread at both ends and slowly stretches it until the material fails, measuring the force as it's happening.\"</p><p>Using this method, they have found that the silk is stronger than steel. It has also been referred to as <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011234\">the toughest biomaterial known</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0396ndv\"}}</p><p>They may sound similar, but there is a difference between toughness and strength. Strong materials are resistant to stress, but tough materials are stretchy, meaning they can absorb more energy before breaking. This is essential in a spider's web, as each strand has to resist the impact and thrashing movements of prey without disturbing the rest of the structure.</p><p>The combination of strength and toughness is highly sought after by engineers seeking to make new materials, from body armour to fishing nets.

Not all snakes are venomous, but certain groups have evolved to channel toxins through grooves or tubes in their teeth.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/540\">Dr Bryan Fry</a> of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, one of his local species produces more venom than any other.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035r91m\"}}</p><p>\"The mulga snake has exceeded 1.3g of dry venom from a single milking,\" says Fry, whose passion for his subject has earned him the nickname \"Venom Doc\".</p><blockquote><p> The deathstalker's venom is delivered in short bursts </p></blockquote><p>Also known as the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1055558/overview\">king brown snake</a>, this species is common across Australia. It shelters under timber and rubbish piles. Fortunately, despite the seeming abundance of venomous snakes, snake bites are rare in the country.</p><p>Fry says several large snakes can produce a similar yield of venom, including the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1055746/overview\">king cobra</a> from India, the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1057054/overview\">Gaboon viper</a> of sub-Saharan Africa and the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/795271/overview\">eastern diamondback rattlesnake</a> from the US.</p><p>However, yield is not the only way to measure how venomous a species is. That is highlighted by the species often described as the world's most venomous scorpion: the dramatically-named <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/10208954/overview\">deathstalker</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035xtls\"}}</p><p>This pale yellow arachnid lives in deserts in the Middle East. It hunts at night for worms, centipedes and other invertebrates.</p><blockquote><p> The more targeted the venom, the more damage it can do </p></blockquote><p>Scorpions paralyse their prey with their notorious sting. Known as the telson, this last segment of their tail contains venom sacs and a barb that injects the toxins.</p><p>At the opposite end of the scale to the mulga snake, the deathstalker's venom is delivered in short bursts to hit its small prey. Yet despite never growing longer than 11cm, the deathstalker packs a serious punch. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/15569548409097925\">Tests suggest that 0.25mg of deathstalker venom would be enough to kill 1kg-worth of mice</a>.</p><p>That is a pretty potent venom. But even this seemingly precise measure is tricky to interpret, because not all venom is equal.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035r949\"}}</p><p>Venom can be used as a defence against predators or to attack prey. The more targeted the venom, the more damage it can do. So it is not easy to find the most venomous animal on Earth, since they have evolved to target different species.</p><p>Lacking enthusiastic human volunteers for their trials, scientists have tended to test venoms on mice. These studies reveal the \"median lethal dose\", meaning how much venom it takes to kill 50% of the mice being tested.</p><p>This isn't a perfect measure, because many animals are quite unlike mice. But it is the best we have, and the current chart-toppers might surprise you: marine snails.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035r915\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/50322/overview\">Cone snails</a> are carnivores. Being slow-moving, they have shells that act like suits of armour, but they can also deploy venom when threatened. Some species eat worms while others pick off fish. It is the latter that pack the biggest venomous punch.</p><p>\"For species of cone snail that hunt fish it is important to have a very fast-acting and powerful venom, because otherwise fish can easily escape from such a slow moving predator,\" says <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/ronald-jenner.html\">Dr Ronald Jenner</a> of the Natural History Museum in London, UK.</p><blockquote><p> Its venom can wreak devastating effects on the human nervous system, blood, muscles and organs </p></blockquote><p>To take down their targets, cone snails have modified teeth called \"radulae\". They are sharp, hooked and hollow, like a cross between a harpoon and a hypodermic needle. The snail launches one at an unsuspecting fish, whereupon it delivers a cocktail of toxins that target the nervous system. Once the fish is paralysed, the cone snail can devour it.</p><p>Cone snails constantly produce new radulae so they are rarely without their killer cutlery. The teeth are sharp enough to pierce wetsuit fabric and pose a problem for divers. The <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/2988801/overview\">geography cone snail</a> has a beautiful mottled shell that often attracts people, but it is also one of the most venomous species.</p><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.09.011\">The human lethal dose for its venom has been estimated at just 0.029-0.038mg for every kg of body mass</a>. 65% of human stinging cases are fatal without medical attention &ndash; although only 36 such fatalities have been recorded since 1670.</p><p>That brings us to the final factor influencing venomous animals: how likely they are to pose a threat.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035r954\"}}</p><p>The <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1055702/overview\">inland taipan</a>, which also goes by the moniker \"fierce snake\", is commonly accepted as the world's most venomous snake based on the potency of its venom. Its median lethal dose for mice has been calculated at 0.025mg/kg. It only hunts mammals, so its venom can wreak devastating effects on the human nervous system, blood, muscles and organs.</p><blockquote><p> The black mamba is actually olive-coloured </p></blockquote><p>But the inland taipan lives in the remote deserts of central Australia and biologists describe it as reclusive. Its <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1055703/overview\">coastal cousin</a> has a weaker venom, but it is considered by many to be more dangerous. It lives in dunes and woodlands along the tropical coast of Australia, where people are likely to come into contact with it.</p><p>As with most snakes, aggression is a last resort for the coastal taipan. But when it is threatened it can bite several times in quick succession, repeatedly delivering a full load of venom.</p><p>This same behaviour explains why the black mamba has such a vicious reputation.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035r93g\"}}</p><p>Native to sub-Saharan Africa, the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/795080/overview\">black mamba</a> is actually olive-coloured: it is named for the colour of the inside of its mouth. When cornered it displays its open mouth and hisses to warn off the threat. It will only sink its venomous fangs in when provoked further.</p><p>However, humans are not staying away. Growing populations mean that settlements are encroaching on snakes' territories in many parts of the world. That means life-threatening snakebites are a growing problem.</p><p>\"Scorpions sting 500,000 people a year in Mexico alone, with 150,000 of these requiring anti-venom,\" says Fry. \"Snakes, however, bite 1 million people in India alone, with 50,000 of these dying and about half the survivors having some sort of permanent injury.\"</p><p>Venoms may be complicated, but whether you are a diving tourist or a subsistence farmer, it is wise to know them.</p><p>\"Collectively, envenomation is the most neglected of all tropical diseases,\" says Fry.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"One animal is more venomous than any other","HeadlineShort":"The most venomous animal of all","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Snakes are famous for their venom, and justifiably so.

We are most familiar with the idea that sleep is a passive state, when an animal doesn't move much and its muscles relax, but that's not a hard-and-fast rule: some dozing birds can even fly, by sleeping with only half their brain.</p><p>\"Sleep is a way animals become more efficient,\" says Dr Jerome Siegel, director of the <a href=\"http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch\">Center for Sleep Research at UCLA</a> in California, US.</p><p>Some animals sleep far more than others, and Siegel says that is largely down to how much time they spend eating. \"Animals that eat food with low calorific density sleep less, although sleep can adjust to animals' needs.\"</p><p>On the whole, herbivores are said to sleep for less time than carnivores, because they need to spend more time munching to gain enough energy from their food. That is especially true for big grazers like giraffes. In the 1970s, scientists observed that giraffes in the wild only entered deep sleep for 5 to 30 minutes a day.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p036gsz4\"}}</p><p>That sleeplessness could also be a defence mechanism. \"Reduced sleep in more vulnerable animals may be adaptive to increase their vigilance for predators,\" says <a href=\"http://www.latrobe.edu.au/school-life-sciences/about/our-staff/profile?uname=JLesku\">Dr John Lesku from La Trobe University</a> in Melbourne, Australia.</p><blockquote><p> Animals that don't make the right 'decision' are less likely to pass their genes on </p></blockquote><p>Conversely, predators can presumably spend less time watching their backs, especially in social groups. Lions are famed for their habit of lying around for much of the day. In captivity they are known to sleep for 10 to 15 hours a day.</p><p>But rather than having one big session, lions are \"cathemeral\", meaning they sleep opportunistically for short spells. According to Siegel, this is so they don't miss out on a meal.</p><p>\"A hungry animal needs to sleep less if there is food available, and more if there is no food available,\" he says.&nbsp; \"Animals that don't make the right 'decision' are less likely to pass their genes on.\"</p><p>It's worth bearing in mind that few scientists have volunteered to stay up all night to watch sleeping lions, presumably in case the lions wake up. In fact, being able to find wild animals in the first place is one of the biggest obstacles to understanding their sleep patterns.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p036gsp4\"}}</p><p>For example, <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328497/overview\">giant armadillos</a> make it on to lists of sleepy animals due to their habit of spending an average of 18 hours a day in their underground burrows. But there's no evidence that they spend all of this time catching forty winks.</p><blockquote><p> According to a study of koala activity in Victoria, they actually sleep for around 14.5 hours </p></blockquote><p>\"Actually we suspect they also feed, as generally their burrow is near a termite mound and the sleeping chamber is often at the base of the termite mound,\" says Dr Arnaud Desbiez, co-ordinator of the <a href=\"http://giantarmadillo.org.br/\">Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project</a>.</p><p>When we do manage to see what an animal is doing, posture is often key to discerning whether it is asleep.</p><p>For instance, giraffes rest their heads on their rumps. Elsewhere, koalas slump, and they are rumoured to only actually be awake for 2 hours a day.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p036j3k2\"}}</p><p>According to a study of koala activity in Victoria, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO9850655\">they actually sleep for around 14.5 hours and spend almost another 5 hours resting</a>, as their diet of eucalyptus leaves takes effort to digest and only delivers low energy rewards.</p><blockquote><p> My guess is that this was one compromised bat </p></blockquote><p>In a 2013 study, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080366\">wild koalas were fitted with accelerometers to measure their daily activity</a>, but the devices were not sensitive enough to discern rest from sleep. The \"gold standard\" in identifying sleep is to measure the electrical impulses sent by the brain, using electroencephalography (EEG).</p><p>For this reason, the most detailed data on animal sleep comes from captive subjects. According to Lesku, the current record holders for sleep are the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328495/overview\">large hairy armadillo</a> at 20.4 hours and the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311574/overview\">little pocket mouse</a> at 20.1 hours.</p><p>But even these values need to be treated with caution. \"These are wild animals brought into the novel laboratory environment and recorded in a new, potentially dangerous environment with food provided,\" says Lesku.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p036gsz6\"}}</p><p>For instance, a <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/327247/overview\">little brown bat</a> was studied in this way in 1969 and earned the animals a reputation for being the longest sleepers. It got 19.9 hours of shut eye in a 24-hour period.</p><blockquote><p> When animals like bats go into torpor during periods of cold temperatures, we call it hibernation </p></blockquote><p>But it was attached to a computer rather than hanging from its usual cave ceiling, and the temperatures were altered. \"My guess is that this was one compromised bat and hardly representative of a wild animal,\" says Lesku.</p><p>In particular, it may not have been sleeping at all. Instead, it could have gone into a more extreme state called torpor.</p><p>Many animals can go into an energy-saving state called torpor. When animals like bats go into torpor during periods of cold temperatures, we call it hibernation. In high temperatures it is known as aestivation.</p><p>Some animals go into torpor every day. The <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328595/overview\">American badger</a> and <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1179470/overview\">elegant fat-tailed mouse possum</a> can both clock up an average of 14 hours, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12137\">according to a 2014 review</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p036gsq0\"}}</p><p>Torpor is fundamentally different to sleep. It is a kind of dormancy: metabolic rate and body temperature both drop and brain activity is dramatically decreased, in order to conserve energy.</p><blockquote><p> 40% of the day is a remarkable amount of rest time </p></blockquote><p>To test the true sleeping brain activity of animals in the wild, scientists started with the most renowned sleepers: sloths.</p><p>In captivity they are known to sleep for more than 15 hours, but in 2008 researchers found that wild sloths sleep far less. After fitting <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328518/overview\">brown-throated sloths</a> in Panama with small EEG recorders, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0203\">they discovered the animals were sleeping for less than 10 hours</a>.

a dry, open field in New Mexico, US, a hungry lizard spots a brightly-coloured, hairy insect scurrying across the sandy soil. Thinking it has found a meal, the lizard sprints to catch the insect. But once it has the insect in its mouth, it finds it is too hard to chew.</p><p>The lizard then moves the insect around to find a softer chewing angle but gets nowhere. Meanwhile the insect starts to squeak and finally stings the luckless lizard in its mouth. Alarmed, the lizard spits it out.</p><p>The insect, still squeaking, gets away unscathed. The lizard is left with nothing but a sore mouth and a foul taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This sturdy insect is a female velvet ant. These females have an arsenal of defences unmatched by their male partners, or any other insect. The question is, what terrifying predator forced the females to evolve so many defences? And if they are in such dire threat from predators, why are they brightly coloured?&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0353hmh\"}}</p><p>Let's get the confusing bit out of the way first. Velvet ants are not really ants: they are wasps. They got their name because the females look like large ants, albeit ants clothed in dense velvety hairs of various hues: they can be yellow, orange, red, white or black.</p><blockquote><p> Female velvet ants have taken the idea of warning colouration to a whole new level </p></blockquote><p>In most species, males are rather plain-looking. They are so unlike the bright and furry females, it can be hard to tell which male pairs with which female.</p><p>When faced with a predator, the males have an obvious advantage. They have wings, so they can simply fly away.</p><p>However, the females are both grounded and conspicuous. Their bright colours may seem like a dead giveaway, but they are actually a signal warning predators to stay away &ndash; just like the bright colours of a wasp warn predators that it can sting.</p><p>What's more, female velvet ants have taken the idea of warning colouration to a whole new level.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03539b7\"}}</p><p>Different species of velvet ants have evolved to mimic each other. By resembling other velvet ant species from their neighbourhood, these solitary creatures have found strength in numbers.</p><blockquote><p> When a velvet ant becomes aware of a threat, it starts to squeak </p></blockquote><p>Na&iuml;ve predators that try to tackle a velvet ant soon get the message, and steer clear of them in future. By all flashing the same signal, the velvet ants ensure that they all share in this protection.</p><p>Among the velvet ants of North America, the colour mimicry is extremely widespread. In a study published in August 2015, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.053\">researchers grouped over 300 species into just 8 mimicry clusters</a>, based on similarities in colour, hair density and location. They range from silvery and downy velvet ants found in the hot deserts to the brownish-red and bald species found east of the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>But this colour signalling is just the start of the velvet ants' arsenal. They also use a combination of audio and chemical signalling to deter predators.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03539g6\"}}</p><p>When a velvet ant becomes aware of a threat, it starts to squeak or \"stridulate\".</p><blockquote><p> Velvet ants can deter predators by releasing odours </p></blockquote><p>It does this by moving different sections of its abdomen in and out. This motion rubs a tooth-like projection on the second section, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2012.736241\">the \"scraper\"</a>, against a ridged structure on the third section, the \"file\".</p><p>The resulting squeaky noise can warn off predators while they are still at a distance. But a velvet ant can also stridulate if it gets caught unawares and picked up in a predator's mouth.</p><p>To the predator, that might feel \"like a mini jackhammer going zzzzzzzzzzz\" in its mouth, says entomologist <a href=\"http://cis.arl.arizona.edu/people\">Justin Schmidt</a> of the Southwest Biological Institute in Tucson, Arizona, US. If this sensation was unpleasant enough, the predator would open its mouth and the velvet ant would escape.</p><p>On top of their squeaking, velvet ants can deter predators by releasing odours.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03539ds\"}}</p><p>They have well-developed glands that secrete smelly \"allomones\": chemicals that manipulate the behaviour of another species.</p><blockquote><p> They are also agile and remarkably strong </p></blockquote><p>Specifically, they make ketones, which ants are known to use as alarm pheromones. That makes sense: velvet ants often come across ants, so they may have evolved specific allomones to repel the ants, which Schmidt and his colleagues once described as \"<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00990473\">major potential predators</a>\" of velvet ants.</p><p>In experiments, tiny flags coated with one of these ketones were enough to trigger alarm behaviour among harvester and carpenter ant workers. The same flags also prompted fire ants to scatter until the ketones had evaporated. Similarly, fire ant workers fed less when their honey was laced with a cocktail of ketones.</p><p>So velvet ants look scary, sound scary and smell scary. They are also agile and remarkably strong.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03539cg\"}}</p><p>In <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1977.tb02663.x\">a study published in 1977</a>, Schmidt and his PhD advisor <a href=\"http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/onlineathens/obituary.aspx?pid=174491209\">Murray Blum</a> presented velvet ants to a selection of predators, including ants, spiders, a praying mantis, lizards, birds and gerbils.</p><blockquote><p> A velvet ant has a hard, slippery and rounded outer shell </p></blockquote><p>When attacked by a few <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/403244/overview\">red fire ants</a>, the velvet ants freed themselves by quickly scraping the ants off using their strong and muscular legs. However, when attacked by many ants at once, the velvet ant both removed the fire ants faster and ran faster to escape.</p><p>Schmidt and Blum repeatedly chased velvet ants with their fingers and estimated that they could scamper at about 0.5km/h (0.3mph). They can achieve these speeds because certain muscles, which in winged males control flight, are used to make the females' legs stronger, says Schmidt.</p><p>A female velvet ant's legs are so powerful, adds Schmidt, she can use them to wrestle her way out of a predator's mouth. You might think that a bigger animal like a lizard could easily crush her in its jaws, but the velvet ant is too tough for that.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0353hm0\"}}</p><p>A velvet ant has a hard, slippery and rounded outer shell, and this saves it from being crunched. Schmidt and Blum calculated that the force required for successfully crushing a velvet ant is about 11 times that for a worker honeybee, and almost twice that for a stag beetle.</p><blockquote><p> What it lacks in toxicity it makes up for in sheer pain </p></blockquote><p>In line with that, when insect collectors try to pin down a dead velvet ant, they often miss because the pin glances off and pierces their finger.</p><p>Schmidt's experiments show that a velvet ant's tough shell helps to protect it from spiders, which try to inject it with venom.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If none of that is enough to deter a predator, a velvet ant packs a legendarily painful sting.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035393b\"}}</p><p>Only females have stingers. That's because the stinger, which is highly flexible and half as long as the insect itself, is <a href=\"http://www.publish.csiro.au/pid/2533.htm\">a modified egg-laying organ called an ovipositor</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Dasymutilla velvet ants are sometimes known as \"cow killers\", which is ridiculous as their sting is essentially harmless </p></blockquote><p>The venom from a velvet ant's sting is <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0041-0101(80)90054-9\">only mildly toxic</a>, being <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0041-0101(86)90091-7\">one of the least chemically active insect venoms</a> compared to other stinging wasps, ants and bees. But what it lacks in toxicity it makes up for in sheer pain &ndash; something Schmidt can attest to.</p><p>In 2015, Schmidt was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize \"<a href=\"http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2015\">for painstakingly creating the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, which rates the relative pain people feel when stung by various insects</a>\". <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.940010205\">In a study published in 1984</a>, he rated insect stings from 1 to 4, where 4 is the most painful, based on how it felt when insects stung him. So he knows exactly how painful a velvet ant sting is.</p><p>One genus of velvet ants is particularly excruciating. <em><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/73362/overview\">Dasymutilla</a> </em>velvet ants are sometimes known as \"cow killers\", which is ridiculous as their sting is essentially harmless &ndash; apart from the pain.</p><p>Schmidt rated their stings between 2 and 3. He later described the sting of <em><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/3817127/overview\">D. klugii</a></em> females as causing \"<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402062421\">intense burning</a>\", with \"variable reactions\" lasting 5&ndash;30 minutes.</p><p>Given that they don't have stingers, males shouldn't be able to sting. But they have found a way to fake it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p035391h\"}}</p><p>Unlike a lot of velvet ant researchers, <a href=\"http://www.insectevolutionlab.com/\">Joseph Wilson</a> of Utah State University Tooele in the US has never been stung by a female. But he has been stung by males.</p><blockquote><p> There's nothing that we have found that regularly eats velvet ants </p></blockquote><p>\"When you grab them they will aggressively poke you with the pointed parts of their genitalia,\" says Wilson. \"They can feel like little needles sticking into your finger.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402062421\">This fake sting can be enough to dupe a predator into letting a male go</a>. \"Generally, the pseudo-sting isn't too painful but it can surprise you if you aren't expecting it,\" says Wilson.</p><p>Clearly, velvet ants are not insects to mess with. But it has proved surprisingly difficult to identify the predator that they are defending themselves from.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03547pn\"}}</p><p>Lizards have long been the prime suspects. They are active at the same times and in the same locations as velvet ants, and they eat insects that are similar to velvet ants.</p><blockquote><p> The velvet ants almost always escaped unharmed </p></blockquote><p>In the 1980s, two biologists studying the diets of <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/455023/overview\">collared lizards</a> in the southern US <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3671473\">found velvet ants in the stomachs of two females</a>. Once in a while <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1564347\">skinks</a> and <a href=\"http://dergipark.ulakbim.gov.tr/tbtkzoology/article/view/5000027118\">frogs</a> have also been found to eat them. But such reports have been few and far between. &nbsp;</p><p>\"There are some instances when potential predators will eat [velvet ants], but in general there's nothing that we have found that regularly eats velvet ants,\" says Wilson. He is currently trying to find out if <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/12132499/overview\">western whiptail lizards</a> eat them.</p><p>\"There aren't really any true or meaningful predators,\" agrees Schmidt.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03547kw\"}}</p><p>Schmidt could not identify any in his experiments. Ants, spiders, lizards and gerbils all attacked velvet ants, but the velvet ants almost always escaped unharmed.</p><blockquote><p> Maybe their defences did not evolve to deal with predators after all </p></blockquote><p>A tarantula and a gerbil did manage to eat one each, but that was it. Some predators gave up after one or two attempts and others after being stung, even though they habitually preyed upon stinging wasps and toxic ants. &nbsp;</p><p>In an intriguing experiment published in 2001, researchers dropped four velvet ant species into enclosures housing insect-eating <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1055604/overview\">Texas horned lizards</a>. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3672534\">The lizards only ate the ones that looked like the harvester ants they normally eat</a>, and ignored the rest. &nbsp;</p><p>That suggests velvet ants only get eaten by accident, by predators targeting the ants they resemble. So maybe their defences did not evolve to deal with predators after all.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0353hmw\"}}</p><p>Instead, it's conceivable that they evolved to protect the velvet ants when they lay their eggs.</p><blockquote><p> You've got to have enough defences so that you can make it through </p></blockquote><p>After mating, a female velvet ant sets off alone to find the closed underground nests of solitary wasps or bees. These insects seal their larvae inside their burrows with some food, and never return. The velvet ant female breaks into the nest and lays an egg inside.</p><p>When the velvet ant larva hatches, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5479/si.03629236.143.1\">it feasts on the larva</a>, munching its way into its innards. It then pupates inside the nest and makes its way out as a fully-grown adult.</p><p>According to Schmidt, this \"parasitoid\" lifestyle is fraught with risk.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0353hpr\"}}</p><p>\"You have a pretty hard time finding your hosts, which are often widely dispersed,\" he says. \"If you are spending hundreds and hundreds of hours exposed, with people looking at you like, 'oh yum, dinner', you've got to have enough defences so that you can make it through.\"</p><p>This is doubly true for velvet ants that, instead of targeting the undefended nests of solitary insects, break into the guarded nests of social wasps and bees.</p><p>These large nests are tempting targets, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001704\">because they offer a lot of egg-laying opportunities in one place</a>, but they are also more dangerous so only a few velvet ants tackle them.</p><p>One such species is <em><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/3817168/overview\">Mutilla europaea</a>.</em></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0353hm7\"}}</p><p>It once targeted bumblebees, with great success. Records from the 19th century note instances when more velvet ants hatched from a bumblebee nest than did bumblebees. They also wreaked havoc in honeybee hives.</p><blockquote><p> If the wasps do attack the velvet ant, its hardened shell protects it </p></blockquote><p>Nowadays, <em>M.</em> <em>europaea</em> velvet ants are occasionally seen strolling into the nests of <em><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1032842/overview\">Polistes biglumis</a></em>, a species of social paper wasp. They are there, not to lay eggs, but to eat &ndash; and they have picked an unusual diet.</p><p>These velvet ants suck the saliva from wasp larvae, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-012-9362-4\">without inflicting any visible damage upon them</a>. \"Larval saliva is highly nutritious,\" says <a href=\"http://naturali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=clorenzi\">Maria Cristina Lorenzi</a> of the University of Turin, Italy.</p><p>Lorenzi found that an <em>M. europaea </em>female can sneak around a paper wasp nest unobserved. That's thanks to the chemical makeup of its outer shell, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.06.013\">which has low concentrations of certain chemicals that cause the wasps to recognize and attack intruders</a>. If the wasps do attack the velvet ant, its hardened shell protects it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03538zq\"}}</p><p>Clearly, velvet ants like <em>M. europaea</em> have good reason to evolve defences against the insects they are targeting. But that can't explain the other defences, like colour mimicry and squeaking, which play no role in this.</p><p>That brings us back to the idea of predators and the threat they pose to velvet ants.</p><blockquote><p> It seems to me like it might be kind of a fun life to be a velvet ant </p></blockquote><p>\"We think it's just about predation,\" says Wilson. \"Maybe there's an extinct predator, and these defences evolved in connection with some predator that we are not able to identify because it's no longer here.\"</p><p>Alternatively, it may be that velvet ants were faced with a multitude of predators, all using different strategies, so had to evolve a range of defences to safeguard against them all. \"Different characteristics defend better against different predators,\" says Wilson.</p><p>In that case, maybe the reason so few animals eat them is simply that their defences are effective. Evolution has pushed them to have so many defences that, nowadays, most predators target easier prey.</p><p>\"They are such masters of life,\" says Schmidt. \"They really have figured [out] how to survive and do everything right. It seems to me like it might be kind of a fun life to be a velvet ant.\"</p><p>There's one last thing.

A white grub is stuck to her abdomen, and it's growing bigger while the spider shrinks.</p><p>One day, the spider stops building her usual orb web. Instead, she keeps repeating the first few steps, creating a \"cocoon web\": a bag, strong enough to withstand Costa Rica's heavy tropical rains.</p><p>The large grub now turns ruthless. It sucks out the spider's remaining life juices and throws out the skinny remains. Then <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35018636\">it spins a cocoon for itself</a>, supported by the cocoon web. A few weeks later a wasp emerges, with a slender waist and metallic sheen. The grub has grown up.</p><p>The ghoulish wasp is called <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/10560901/overview\"><em>Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga</em></a>.

But in fact this sort of behaviour is astonishingly common. The wasps that lay their eggs on the bodies of other animals may well be the most diverse group of animals on Earth. Nature, it seems, loves animals that play dirty.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqfg\"}}</p><p>These wasps lay eggs onto other animals, which their larvae then feed on. In many cases, the hosts are still alive when their insides are being eaten. This ensures a living larder chock-full of fresh food.</p><p>When the larvae are ready to pupate, they normally kill their host. Until this point, they are completely dependent on their hosts for nourishment and protection.</p><p>This lifestyle has an unusual name. The wasps are not strictly parasites like tapeworms, as parasites don't as a rule kill their hosts. But they also don't kill their hosts as quickly and surely as a predator like a lion would. They are somewhere in between: \"<a href=\"http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c20/e6-142-tpe-29.pdf\">parasitoids</a>\".</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwr8n\"}}</p><p>They infest a host of small critters, from social insects like ants and bees to flies and caterpillars.</p><blockquote><p> There are probably more species of them than any other kind of animal on Earth </p></blockquote><p>All parasitoids specialise in attacking one host species, usually during a particular stage of its life cycle. This specialisation has given rise to a huge diversity of parasitoids.</p><p>Estimates about the number of parasitoid species vary widely: most are tiny, so there are many undiscovered species. Some put the cap at 2 million.</p><p>\"There are probably more species of them than any other kind of animal on Earth,\" says <a href=\"http://biology.uiowa.edu/people/andrew-forbes\">Andrew Forbes</a> of the University of Iowa in Iowa City. \"If you stop and think about the sheer number of animals on Earth that make a living by laying eggs in other animals and doing all sorts of horrible things to them before consuming them alive, it can give one pause.\"</p><p>The ancestral parasitoid wasp was probably similar to modern <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/48147/overview\" target=\"_blank\">sawflies</a>, which <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.129\" target=\"_blank\">feed on dead wood that has been digested by symbiotic fungi</a>. It may be that one species lost the fungi, so started killing other species that did.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqtv\"}}</p><p>The first order of business for an adult parasitoid is to find a suitable host. She first identifies its preferred habitat, which has a distinct look and smell. Then it's a matter of laying an egg appropriately.</p><blockquote><p> The wasp may stab the caterpillar in this way a dozen times </p></blockquote><p>To pull this off, most parasitoid wasps have a needle-like organ with which to stab their hosts. For instance, <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/3777546/overview\"><em>Iseropus</em></a> wasps thrust their eggs into the larvae of <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/64156/overview\"><em>Hemerocampa</em></a> moths. In a 1929 lecture, the entomologist <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/0-306-48380-7_1120\">Robert Cushman</a> described the attack in detail.</p><p><em>Iseropus</em> attacks the <em>Hemerocampa</em> caterpillar late in its life, when it has already built its cocoon in an elm tree. The wasp lands on the tree and feels around for the cocoon.</p><p>\"Eagerly she tests it all over until, apparently satisfied that it suits her purpose, she takes a firm hold with her feet, arches her abdomen until the stiletto points perpendicularly toward the cocoon, then thrusts it through the meshes,\" according to Cushman. The wasp may stab the caterpillar in this way a dozen times.</p><p>Other species have to work far harder. Their hosts can fight back.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwrps\"}}</p><p>The startling, metallic <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1073202/overview\"><em>Lasiochalcidia pubescens</em></a> (sometimes <em>L. igiliensis</em>) lays her eggs on the larvae of antlions. That sounds like a monumentally bad idea, because antlion larvae are ferocious predators.</p><blockquote><p> She provokes the antlion to attack her legs </p></blockquote><p>They dig small pits into sand, then bury themselves at the bottom. When a luckless ant enters the pit it slides down the side, and the antlion grabs it in its powerful jaws.</p><p>Despite the risks, <em>L. pubescens</em> has evolved to lay her eggs in the antlion's throat.</p><p>She provokes the antlion to attack her legs with its mandibles. When the antlion grabs on, she holds its jaws apart using her muscular legs, and carefully injects an egg into the membrane of the antlion's exposed throat.</p><p>Other parasitoids are far more cautious. They don't even approach their hosts, and instead leave eggs for them to find.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqvs\"}}</p><p>One family, the <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/732/overview\">Eucharitids</a>, use ant larvae as hosts. They lay their eggs on plants near ant nests. When the wasp larvae emerge, they sit around until they encounter an ant heading back to its nest.</p><blockquote><p> Other parasitoids must venture into truly dangerous territory </p></blockquote><p>Once inside the ant nest, the parasitoid larva attaches to an ant larva. It emits a chemical bouquet so similar to its ant hosts that the ants accept its presence.</p><p>Even when it becomes an adult wasp, the ants treat it as one of their own, grooming and feeding it. Before the ant-mimicking odour wears off, the wasp emerges from the nest and leaves.</p><p>Other parasitoids must venture into truly dangerous territory to find their hosts. One Japanese species has learned to scuba-dive.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwr8c\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/3783489/overview\"><em>Agriotypus gracilis</em></a> lays her eggs in the pupae of a caddisfly called <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/480495/overview\"><em>Goera japonica</em></a>. Like all caddisflies, these larvae build protective cases out of silk and sand grains. They also live 6-15 inches underwater.</p><blockquote><p> Larvae that develop inside a host's body need to obtain some air </p></blockquote><p>To reach one, the female wasp crawls down a plant stem or the side of an exposed stone. She can survive about 14 minutes underwater. Her thick hair forms a sort of bubble that allows her to breathe.</p><p>After laying an egg, the female floats to the surface to look for another pupa. Once the larvae hatch, they usually eat up their host.</p><p>Larvae like these have it easy. They are outside the host's body, so can breathe normally. However, larvae that develop inside a host's body need to obtain some air.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqm7\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/844496/overview\"><em>Encyrtus infidus</em></a> is a parasitoid on the scale insect <em>Lecanium kunoensis</em> (sometimes called <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/837175/overview\"><em>Eulecanium kunoense</em></a>). <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/25.4.670\">Many parasitoid larvae develop on one scale larva</a>, and use it as a buffet.</p><blockquote><p> They turn their hosts into their personal bodyguards </p></blockquote><p>At first, the larvae remain attached to the egg from which they hatched by a stalk. This helps them get their air. Later, the scale's innards get crowded, the larvae start competing for space, and the stalk gets cut. But the wasp larva has a solution.</p><p>The scale larva has a network of tubes that supply air throughout its body, called trachea. Each trachea ends in an opening called a spiracle, through which the scale larva exchanges air with its surroundings.</p><p>When the parasitoid larva loses connection with its egg, it fuses its spiracles with the tracheal system of the scale and \"steals\" air until it pupates.</p><p>Other parasitoids do more than steal their hosts' air. They turn their hosts into their personal bodyguards.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwpmj\"}}</p><p>Among the leafy undergrowth of Brazil, the parasitoid <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/3771437/overview\"><em>Glyptapanteles</em></a> seeks out caterpillars of the moth <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/443942/overview\"><em>Thyrinteina leucoceraea</em></a> and deposits up to 80 eggs. The host caterpillar continues feeding even after the larvae hatch from the eggs.</p><blockquote><p> It swings its head violently from side to side to keep predators at bay </p></blockquote><p>The parasitoids feed on the caterpillar's insides until they are ready to pupate. Then, almost all of them eat their way out of the still-living caterpillar, and spin a cocoon on a nearby twig or leaf.</p><p>However, a few of them stay inside the caterpillar. Their job is to control the caterpillar and make it guard their pupating brothers and sisters.</p><p>The beleaguered caterpillar stops eating. It uses its body, which by this point is riddled with holes, as a tent to protect the pupae. It also <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002276\">swings its head violently from side</a> to side to keep predators at bay. Once the wasps emerge, the caterpillar dies.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwr8n\"}}</p><p>After pupation, the adult has to emerge from its host's body. This is the particularly gruesome bit, and resembles nothing so much as the famous chest-burster scene from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/\"><em>Alien</em></a>.</p><blockquote><p> The wasp comes forth very largely covered with body fluids and fragments of tissue of the host </p></blockquote><p>Writing in 1932, Curtis Clausen explained that the adult wasp \"<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/25.4.670\">must first effect a break in the puparium which surrounds it and then scrape or bite away a varying amount of host viscera or tissue, and finally cut a hole in the heavily chitinised integument&hellip;</a>\"</p><p>All this biting and cutting creates an almighty mess, and \"the wasp comes forth very largely covered with body fluids and fragments of tissue of the host.\" While the wasp \"is readily and quickly cleaned\", the luckless host \"dies immediately as a result of this gross mutilation\".</p><p>Once this is over with, the adult wasps have one task left in order to complete the cycle. They must mate.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqgs\"}}</p><p>The males do nothing towards the care of the eggs, so their only task is to fertilise females.</p><p>In some parasitoids, males fly around searching for chemical signals secreted by receptive females. But sometimes the roles are reversed. In some species of the genus <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/35253/overview\"><em>Melittobia</em></a>, which infects the larvae of solitary bees and wasps, males produce odours that attract females in droves.</p><p><em>Melittobia</em> lays eggs in its hosts just before they pupate. The female stings the host into submission, then lays a cluster of eggs on the outer surface. This simple act launches a bizarre sexual drama.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqns\"}}</p><p>The larvae feed through the host's skin, pupate and become wasps. Almost all of them are female. If the host is large enough, the eggs develop rapidly into short-winged females. These lay even more eggs, draining the host completely.</p><blockquote><p> Brothers fight one another for access to their emerging sisters </p></blockquote><p>Eggs laid later develop into long-winged females, which chew through the host cocoon and fly out to find more victims.</p><p>Meanwhile, within the cocoon the few blind males begin courting the females. They raise and lower their legs, stroke the females with their legs and antennae, and flutter their wings, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ento.54.110807.090440\">according to a 2008 study</a> by <a href=\"http://www.ent.uga.edu/personnel/faculty/matthews.htm\">Robert Matthews</a> of the University of Georgia in Athens.</p><p>Competition among the males is fierce. \"Brothers fight one another for access to their emerging sisters,\" according to Matthews.

All these eggs develop into males.</p><p>She stays around, stroking her sons with her antennae, watching them grow into pupae and then emerge as adults. While most female parasitoids abandon their offspring as soon as the legs are laid, <em>Melittobia</em> females can be positively maternal.</p><p>When the first adult male emerges, the female mates with him. Having been fertilised by her own son, she lays a full clutch of eggs on the same host.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwqzy\"}}</p><p>If that strikes you as a rather peculiar way to reproduce, brace yourself, because <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/846894/overview\"><em>Copidosoma floridanum</em></a> has gone one better. \"These wasps invented genetic cloning long before humans even had an inkling of the idea,\" says <a href=\"http://www.werrenlab.org/\">John Werren</a> of the University of Rochester in New York.</p><p>A female <em>C. floridanum</em> lays a single egg in the egg of a <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/873/overview\">noctuid moth</a>.

Once the host reaches its final larval stage, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-7322(90)90002-7\">the parasitoid larvae start eating it and develop rapidly</a>.</p><blockquote><p> By killing their half-brothers, they make food for their identical sisters </p></blockquote><p>\"As the embryos begin to develop, they divide, and divide, each egg making identical genetic copies of itself,\" says Werren. \"This is twinning gone berserk.\"</p><p>Among the genetically identical daughters, a subset become \"soldiers\". They develop faster than their sisters and defend the host. If another wasp approaches, they attack her and eat up any eggs she may manage to deposit.</p><p>The soldier females also do something that seems counter-productive: they seek out their brothers and kill them. They do it because they are genetically identical to their sisters, but only share half their DNA with their brothers. By killing their half-brothers, they make food for their identical sisters.</p><p>A few males escape the slaughter. They eventually mate with the fertile females that emerge later, and the cycle goes on.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rwpjm\"}}</p><p>You may feel that parasitoids are irredeemably horrible.

The game is up for untold numbers of deep-sea fish, mountain-dwelling hares, subterranean earthworms and high-flying songbirds. They are all seconds away from becoming dinner for predators like lions, eagles and sharks.</p><p>But when did this carnage begin? Have predators stalked the Earth since the origin of life itself? Or was our primordial planet once a Garden of Eden where species lived in peaceful co-existence?</p><p>The truth is, no one actually knows for sure. But evolutionary biologists have learned enough about the history of life on Earth to begin the hunt for the first predator. Their work suggests it was about as far removed in appearance from today's killers as it's possible to imagine.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9qjz\"}}</p><p>Before we pick up the trail, it might help to spell out what a predator is. According to most biologists, <a href=\"http://www.nrm.se/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021552/Bengtson2002predation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">predation must involve the death of one living thing at the hands (or teeth, or claws) of another</a>, which has to gain some nutritional benefit from the kill. A lion is a predator because it kills and eats a gazelle, but the gazelle is not a predator, because it doesn't have to kill the grasses it eats.</p><blockquote><p> Predators can kill without inflicting physical injury </p></blockquote><p>What sort of traces would the first predator have left behind? We often think of predators using jaws and sharp teeth to rip chunks out of their prey, so maybe we should look for the oldest jaws and teeth. In fact, just last year, we learned that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature.2013.13823\" target=\"_blank\">modern vertebrate jaws date back 420 million years</a> and that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12645\" target=\"_blank\">teeth appeared 500 million years ago</a>.</p><p>But predators can kill without inflicting physical injury. Think of the <a href=\"http://blogs.kqed.org/science/video/predatory-plant-lure-of-the-cobra-lily/\" target=\"_blank\">predatory pitcher plants</a> that trap, drown and devour insects. So if predators don't need teeth and jaws, they might have appeared long before the 500-million-year mark.</p><p>It turns out they really did. Palaeontologists have collected fossils of predators that existed tens of millions of years before teeth evolved. These predators date right back to the first abundant animal life, about 540 million years ago.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9q1c\"}}</p><p>They are known collectively as the anomalocaridids, a name that translates as \"abnormal shrimp\". It's well chosen: the anomalocaridids were odd-looking marine animals that to our eyes seem to have been cobbled together from bits of various different species. They grew up to 2 m (6ft) in length, and had good eyes and a pair of dextrous graspers near their mouth. They may have lacked teeth and jaws but they were undoubtedly terrors of the seas they occupied.</p><p>\"Anomalocaridids are the earliest 'mega-predator',\" says <a href=\"http://easweb.eas.ualberta.ca/page/directory/?person=leigl\" target=\"_blank\">Lindsey Leighton</a> at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.</p><p>Originally palaeontologists thought a hunting anomalocaridid would have used the formidable ring of plates around its mouth to crush its prey. But disappointingly, an analysis a few years ago suggested that <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/11/anomalocaris-trilobite-bite/\" target=\"_blank\">these plates were too weak to crush anything</a>. The anomalocaridids may actually have used their mouths <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/05/cambrian-shutter-of-doom-becomes-sucker-of-worms/\" target=\"_blank\">to suck up soft worms from the muddy ocean floor</a>.</p><p><strong>To crush or to suck?</strong></p><p>But were these worm-sucking anomalocaridids the original predators? In July 2014, we learned something new that helps answer the question. An exceptionally well-preserved fossil revealed that, for all their sophisticated appearance, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13486\" target=\"_blank\">anomalocaridids had simple brains</a>. What's more, other well-preserved fossils from the same time period show that the animals living alongside the anomalocaridids - including some that the predators might have eaten - <a href=\"http://uanews.org/story/brain-of-world-s-first-known-predators-discovered\" target=\"_blank\">had relatively complex brains in comparison</a>.</p><p>This actually fits with what we know about today's predators, says <a href=\"http://neurosci.arizona.edu/nicholas-j-strausfeld\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Strausfeld</a> at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who helped describe the anomalocaridid brain. \"There are many extant examples of what can be considered small-brained species preying on others that have larger brains,\" he says. This shows that predatory behaviour can occur in relatively simple species: the kind that existed before the anomalocaridids evolved.</p><p>\"We subconsciously tend to think of predators as advanced, probably because we envision them at the top of the food web,\" says Leighton. But predatory behaviour may be among the first feeding strategies to appear in ecosystems. \"Actually, herbivory [plant-eating] tends to show up much later.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9qdt\"}}</p><p>In fact, there is evidence that predators existed before the anomalocaridids. Animals first began to grow hard shells and exoskeletons about 550 million years ago. Some of the fossils of these earliest exoskeletons are punctured with circular holes about 0.4 mm across. These are almost certainly <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.257.5068.367\" target=\"_blank\">marks left by predators</a> that bored through the tough armour to feast on the soft tissue hidden within.</p><p>The borings are all similar in shape, which suggests <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1669/0883-1351(2003)0180454:BICSCP2.0.CO;2\" target=\"_blank\">they were made by a single predatory species</a>. We don't yet know what it looked like. But the borings it made are currently the earliest good evidence for relatively large predators, says Leighton. That makes the mystery species responsible a much better candidate for the title of first predator than the anomalocaridids.</p><blockquote><p> The Ediacarans escaped the attention of predators, simply because there weren't any </p></blockquote><p>A look at slightly older rocks and fossils strengthens the case. Between about 575 and 540 million years ago the world was occupied by a peculiar collection of organisms that have been labelled <a href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vendian/ediacaran.php\" target=\"_blank\">the Ediacaran biota</a>. The Ediacaran organisms were large &ndash; some were over 1 m (3 ft) long &ndash; soft-bodied, and mostly incapable of movement. They should have been torn to shreds by predators, but they weren't.</p><p>In the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/facultyprofiles/ma_mcmenamin\" target=\"_blank\">Mark McMenamin</a> at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts suggested that the Ediacarans escaped the attention of predators simply because there weren't any &ndash; or at least, none large enough to pose any real threat. These ecosystems may have been peaceful live-and-let-live worlds in which each Ediacaran used photosynthesis to meet its own energy needs. McMenamin dubbed his idea \"the Garden of Ediacara\".</p><p>In the 30 years since, geologists have found <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-0680-4_4\" target=\"_blank\">little evidence that large predators were active during the Ediacaran period</a>. That suggests McMenamin's ideas may be correct. If they are, we have identified the point in geological time &ndash; about 550 million years ago &ndash; when large predators first appeared.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9q6j\"}}</p><p>But not all predators are large. The world of microbes is teeming with tiny killers. They might be too small to inflict damage on something the size of an Ediacaran, but these predators can still wreak havoc at the microscopic scale - and they were doing so long before the Ediacarans evolved.</p><p>A decade ago, <a href=\"http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/people/susannah-porter\" target=\"_blank\">Susannah Porter</a> at the University of California Santa Barbara and her colleagues discovered tiny fossilised amoebae in 740-million-year-old rocks near the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The amoebae had developed tough skeletons, just like big animals did 550 million years ago did when large predators appeared.</p><p>It seems that at least some of the amoebae grew their skeletons for a similar, defensive reason. Several of the fossils carried <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/0022-3360(2003)0770409:VMFTNC2.0.CO;2\" target=\"_blank\">semi-circular borings about 20 micrometres wide</a>. These were probably the marks left by some unidentified predatory microbe that punctured the tough skeletons to feed on the nutrients within, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141031-the-tiniest-vampires-in-the-world\" target=\"_blank\">rather like vampire amoebae do today</a>.</p><p><strong>Teeny tiny miniature predators</strong></p><p>In the same way that the borings in the 550-million-year-old animals are the earliest strong evidence we have that big predators had evolved, the borings in the 740-million-year-old microfossils are the earliest good evidence of tiny predators.</p><p>But they probably don't signify the moment when predatory behaviour first evolved. More likely they show us when micro-predators began to attack complex microbes, like amoebae, that could evolve hard skeletons in response. Simpler microbes, like bacteria, might have been attacked by micro-predators much earlier in Earth's history, but without ever evolving a defence strategy that can be easily identified in the fossil record.</p><p>In other words, micro-predation probably predates these 740-million-year-old fossils. So we will need a different way to study it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9q3k\"}}</p><p>One approach is to look at the predatory strategies that microbes use today. The most well-known is called engulfment: a relatively large microbe swims up to a smaller cell and swallows it whole. Look at these microbial engulfers, though, and a pattern soon emerges. They are almost all \"eukaryotes\", the group that includes big organisms like animals and plants, as well as microbes like the amoebae. Engulfers seem to be absent from the other great branch of the tree of life, the prokaryotes, which include all the bacteria.</p><blockquote><p> Some prokaryotes force their way into larger cells </p></blockquote><p>No one knows for sure <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00239-014-9643-y\" target=\"_blank\">when the eukaryotes first evolved</a>, but the general consensus is that they came after the prokaryotes, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2006.1843\" target=\"_blank\">around 2 billion years ago</a>. So perhaps engulfment, and predation, began with those first eukaryotes. This would imply that the earlier, prokaryotic-only world was a predator-free zone.</p><p>That seems to fit with what we know about living prokaryotes. \"There are no real prokaryote predators today,\" says <a href=\"http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=599100\" target=\"_blank\">David Penny</a> at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand.</p><p>Or are there? It's true that prokaryotes seem to be incapable of engulfment, says <a href=\"http://departments.agri.huji.ac.il/plantpath/jurkevitch/\" target=\"_blank\">Edouard Jurkevitch</a> at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Rehovot, Israel. But they can use other strategies to prey on cells in their environment. Some prokaryotes force their way into larger cells and digest them from the inside, says Jurkevitch. Others latch onto the side of cells and consume them from the outside. Some even team up with other prokaryotes to form hunting packs that can target entire microbial colonies.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9rd2\"}}</p><p>The general consensus is that <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128275.200-oldest-fossils-show-early-life-was-a-beach.html\" target=\"_blank\">prokaryotes first appeared about 3.5 billion years ago</a>. Perhaps some of them were predatory. \"The roots of predation (and parasitism) may be very ancient,\" says Jurkevitch.</p><p>Penny's research backs this conclusion. A few years ago, he decided to test whether life could have enjoyed a peaceful Garden of Eden-style existence before eukaryotes appeared. He ran computer simulations to see how the first populations of cells would have evolved 3.5 billion years ago, assuming they obeyed a few fundamental biological principles. His results suggest that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005507\" target=\"_blank\">predation is too good a strategy not to evolve rapidly</a>, although predators will usually be heavily outnumbered by organisms that make their own energy.</p><blockquote><p> We don't know what the very first life was like&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>\"It did seem that predation was an inevitable outcome of the principles,\" says Penny. \"Predation appeared within a thousand or so generations.\"</p><p>Penny's theoretical work, and Jurkevitch's observations of prokaryotes today, suggest that there were predators on Earth 3.5 billion years ago, very soon after prokaryotic cells first appeared. So have we finally identified the very first killers? After all, before prokaryotes appeared there was no cellular life at all. We don't know what the very first life was like, but it may have been a loose collection of complex organic chemicals floating in solution. These probably included nucleic acids similar to DNA, such as RNA.</p><p>Remarkably, though, some researchers think predators might have lurked even in this pre-cellular world of chemical replicators.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9qzk\"}}</p><p>About 15 years ago <a href=\"http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/view/cavaliersmith_t.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Cavalier-Smith</a> at the University of Oxford suggested that these nucleic acid communities were a kind of simple ecosystem. Today, some nucleic acids act as catalysts that break up other molecules. Cavalier-Smith reasoned that they probably existed in the pre-cellular communities too. Some of them would have latched onto other nucleic acids and broken them apart, effectively attacking and destroying them to fuel their own growth and replication. In other words, these molecules would have behaved as predators.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.macromol.uni-osnabrueck.de/Mulkidjanian_Research.php\" target=\"_blank\">Armen Mulkidjanian</a> at the University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in Germany, who studies the origins of life, says the idea is reasonable. It's more common for researchers to call this behaviour parasitic, he says. \"But parasitic behaviour, generally, should include predatory behaviour.\"</p><blockquote><p> The biggest hurdle of all is to picture the predators in the primordial soup&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>If Cavalier-Smith is right, then these catalytic nucleic acids really were the very first predators. Go back to the time before they existed and there was no life of any sort, so by definition there can have been no predators.</p><p>From our position as large animals, it's easy to lose perspective on life's history on Earth. Think predators and the first thing that springs to mind might well be a pride of lions or a pack of wolves. It's a big mental leap from these modern killers to the worm-sucking anomalocaridids and the enigmatic predators that patiently drilled their way through defensive armour over half a billion years ago.</p><p>But even that leap is easy compared to the jump we have to make to recognise predators among prokaryotes. And the biggest hurdle of all is to picture the predators in the primordial soup that existed before cellular life. If they existed, they might not have looked particularly fierce, but those killer molecules are hugely significant. They suggest that from its very inception, life has been troubled by predators intent on causing death.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d9rhr\"}}</p>","BusinessUnit":"bbc.com","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-03T10:14:58Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"What was Earth's first predator and when did it live?","HeadlineShort":"First predator to stalk the Earth","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Hunting animals like lions seem advanced to us, but their lifestyle may be truly ancient","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwearth","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":[],"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Hunting animals like lions seem advanced to us, but their lifestyle may be truly ancient","SummaryShort":"Hunting may be a truly ancient behaviour","SuperSection":null,"Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-12-03T10:14:58Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"c9f0349c-9380-45c2-a1a6-32f1e64862a3","Id":"wwearth/story/20141202-what-was-earths-first-predator","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-09-03T09:16:33.706587Z","Project":"wwearth","Slug":"20141202-what-was-earths-first-predator"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwearth/story/20141202-what-was-earths-first-predator","_id":"61026fadc26d32125560ad63"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>Evolution is one of the greatest theories in all of science. It sets out to explain life: specifically, how the first simple life gave rise to all the huge diversity we see today, from bacteria to oak trees to blue whales.</p><p>For scientists, evolution is a fact. We know that life evolved with the same certainty that we know the Earth is roughly spherical, that gravity keeps us on it, and that wasps at a picnic are annoying.</p><p>Not that you would know that from the media in some countries, where evolution is ferociously argued about &ndash; put down as \"just a theory\" or dismissed as a flat-out lie.</p><p>Why are biologists so certain about this? What is the evidence? The short answer is that there is so much it's hard to know where to start. But here is a very cursory summary of the evidence that life has, indeed, evolved.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd3z7\"}}</p><p>It might help to first spell out quickly what Darwin's theory of evolution actually says. Most of us have the general idea: species change over time, only the fittest survive, and somehow a monkey-like creature gave rise to human beings.</p><blockquote><p> It is hard to accept that you are descended, through countless generations, from a worm </p></blockquote><p>Darwin's theory of evolution says that each new organism is subtly different from its parents, and these differences can sometimes help the offspring or impede it. As organisms compete for food and mates, those with the advantageous traits produce more offspring, while those with unhelpful traits may not produce any. So within a given population, advantageous traits become common and unhelpful ones disappear.</p><p>Given enough time, these changes mount up and lead to the appearance of new species and new types of organism, one small change at a time. Step by step, worms became fish, fish came onto land and developed four legs, those four-legged animals grew hair and &ndash; eventually &ndash; some of them started walking around on two legs, called themselves \"humans\" and discovered evolution.</p><p>This can be hard to believe. It's one thing to realise that you are not identical to our parents: perhaps your hair is a different colour, or you are taller, or have a more cheerful nature. But it is much harder to accept that you are descended, through countless generations, from a worm.</p><p>Plenty of people certainly don't accept this. But forget all the drama for a moment. Instead, begin as Charles Darwin did: on your doorstep.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd51d\"}}</p><p>Darwin's book <a href=\"http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1\"><em>On the Origin of Species</em></a>, first published in 1859, begins by asking the reader to look around at the familiar. Not unexplored tropical islands or faraway jungles, but the farmyard and garden. There, you can easily see that organisms pass on characteristics to their offspring, changing the nature of that organism over time.</p><blockquote><p> These changes from generation to generation are called \"descent with modification\" </p></blockquote><p>Darwin was highlighting the process of cultivation and breeding. For generations, farmers and gardeners have purposefully bred animals to be bigger or stronger, and plants to yield more crops.</p><p>Breeders work just like Darwin imagined evolution worked. Suppose you want to breed chickens that lay more eggs. First you must find those hens that lay more eggs than the others. Then you must hatch their eggs, and ensure that the resulting chicks reproduce. These chicks should also lay more eggs.</p><p>If you repeat the process with each generation, eventually you'll have hens that lay far more eggs than wild chickens do. A female jungle fowl &ndash; the closest wild relative of the domestic chicken &ndash; might lay 30 eggs in a year, whereas farm hens may well produce ten times as many.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5f9\"}}</p><p>These changes from generation to generation are called \"descent with modification\".</p><blockquote><p> Our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification </p></blockquote><p>A young chick will in many ways be similar to its parents: it will be recognisably a chicken, and definitely not an aardvark, and it will probably be more similar to its parents than it is to other chickens. But it won't be identical.</p><p>\"That's what evolution is,\" says <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gee/gee-staff/academic-staff/steve-jones\">Steve Jones</a> of University College London in the UK. \"It's a series of mistakes that build up.\"</p><p>You might think that breeding can only make a few changes, but there seems to be no end to it. \"No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation,\" wrote Darwin. \"Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd41d\"}}</p><p>Breeding, Darwin argued, is essentially evolution under human supervision. It shows us that the tiny changes from generation to generation can add up. \"It's inevitable,\" says Jones. \"It's bound to happen.\"</p><p>Still, it's quite a step from carefully breeding chickens that lay more eggs to the natural evolution of new species. According to evolutionary theory, those chickens are ultimately descended from dinosaurs, and if you go further back, from fish.</p><p>The answer is simply that evolution takes a long time to make big changes. To see evidence of that, you have to look at older records. You have to look at fossils.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5hp\"}}</p><p>Fossils are the remains of long-dead organisms, preserved in rock. Because rocks are laid down in layers, one on top of the other, the fossil record is generally set out in date order: the oldest fossils are at the bottom.</p><blockquote><p> I always think that the most convincing case for evolution is in the fossil record </p></blockquote><p>Running through the fossil record makes it clear that life has changed over time.</p><p>The oldest fossils of all are the remains of single-celled organisms like bacteria, with more complicated things like animals and plants only appearing much later. Among the animal fossils, fish appear much earlier than amphibians, birds or mammals. Our closest relatives the apes are only found in the shallowest &ndash; youngest &ndash; rocks.</p><p>\"I always think that the most convincing case for evolution is in the fossil record,\" says Jones. \"It's noticeable that one page in every six in the <em>Origin of Species</em> is to do with the fossil record. [Darwin] knew that that was an irrefutable case that evolution had taken place.\"</p><blockquote><p> How do we really know that one species evolved into another? </p></blockquote><p>By carefully studying fossils, scientists have been able to link many extinct species with ones that survive today, sometimes indicating that one descended from another.</p><p>For example, in 2014 <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2013.793195\">researchers described the fossils of a 55-million year old carnivore called <em>Dormaalocyon</em></a>, which may be a common ancestor of all today's lions, tigers and bears. The shapes of <em>Dormaalocyon</em>'s teeth gave it away.</p><p>Still, you may not be convinced. Those animals may all have similar teeth, but lions, tigers and <em>Dormaalocyons</em> are still distinct species. How do we really know that one species evolved into another?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd450\"}}</p><p>The fossil record is only so much help here, because it is incomplete. \"If you look at most fossil records, what you actually see is one form that lasts quite a long time and then the next bunch of fossils that you've got is quite different from what you had before,\" says Jones.</p><blockquote><p> It is also possible to observe the evolution of a new species as it happens </p></blockquote><p>But as we have dug up more and more remains, a wealth of \"<a href=\"http://www.transitionalfossils.com\">transitional fossils</a>\" has been discovered. These \"missing links\" are halfway houses between familiar species.</p><p>For instance, earlier we said that chickens are ultimately descended from dinosaurs. In 2000 a team led by Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences described <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35047056\">a small dinosaur called <em>Microraptor</em></a>, which had feathers similar to modern birds and may have been able to fly.</p><p>It is also possible to observe the evolution of a new species as it happens.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5jy\"}}</p><p>In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/eeb/people/display_person.xml?netid=rgrant\">Peter and Rosemary Grant</a> of Princeton University in New Jersey described how <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911761106\">a new species of finch came into being on one of the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands</a>: the same islands visited by Darwin.</p><blockquote><p> This little group of birds had formed a new species </p></blockquote><p>In 1981, a single medium ground finch arrived on an island called Daphne Major. He was unusually large and sang a somewhat different song to the local birds.</p><p>He managed to breed, and his offspring inherited his unusual traits. After a few generations, they were reproductively isolated: they looked different from the other birds, and sang different songs, so could only breed among themselves. This little group of birds had formed a new species: they had \"speciated\".</p><p>This new species is only subtly different from its forebears: their beaks are different and they sing an unusual song. But it is possible to watch far more dramatic changes as they happen.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd446\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://myxo.css.msu.edu/\">Richard Lenski</a> of Michigan State University is in charge of the world's longest-running evolution experiment.</p><blockquote><p> It's a very direct demonstration of Darwin's idea of adaptation by natural selection </p></blockquote><p>Since 1988, Lenski has been tracking 12 populations of <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteria in his lab. The bacteria are left to their own devices in storage containers, with nutrients to feed on, and <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27760-cradle-of-creation-evolution-shapes-up-new-ecosystem-in-the-lab\">Lenski's team regularly freezes small samples</a>.</p><p>The <em>E. coli</em> are no longer the same as they were in 1988. \"In all 12 populations, the bacteria have evolved to grow much faster than did their ancestor,\" says Lenski. They have adapted to the specific mix of chemicals he gives them.</p><p>\"It's a very direct demonstration of Darwin's idea of adaptation by natural selection. Now, 20-some years into the experiment, the typical lineage grows about 80% faster than did the ancestor.\"</p><p>In 2008, Lenski's team reported that the bacteria had made a huge leap forward. The mixture they live in includes a chemical called citrate, which <em>E. coli</em> cannot digest. But 31,500 generations into the experiment, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0803151105\">one of the 12 populations started feeding on citrate</a>. This would be like humans suddenly developing the ability to eat tree bark.</p><blockquote><p> All living things carry genes, in the form of DNA </p></blockquote><p>The citrate was always there, says Lenski, \"so all of the populations have [had] the opportunity in a sense to evolve the ability to use this... But only one of the 12 populations has found their way to do this.\"</p><p>At this point, Lenski's habit of regularly freezing samples of the bacteria proved crucial. He was able to go back through older samples, and trace the changes that led to the <em>E. coli</em> eating citrate.</p><p>To do this, he had to look under the hood. He used a tool that wasn't available in Darwin's day, but which has revolutionised our understanding of evolution as a whole: genetics.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5gy\"}}</p><p>All living things carry genes, in the form of DNA.</p><p>Genes control how an organism grows and develops, and they are passed on from parent to offspring. When a mother chicken lays lots of eggs, and passes that trait onto her offspring, she does so through her genes.</p><blockquote><p> All modern life has descended from a single common ancestor </p></blockquote><p>Over the last century scientists have catalogued the genes from different species. It turns out that all living things store information in their DNA in the same way: they all use the same \"genetic code\".</p><p>What's more, organisms also share many genes. Thousands of genes found in human DNA <a href=\"%5bhttp:/ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/125-explore/shared-genes\">may also be found in the DNA of other creatures</a>, including plants and even bacteria.</p><p>These two facts imply that all modern life has descended from a single common ancestor, the \"last universal ancestor\", which lived billions of years ago.</p><p>By comparing how many genes organisms share, we can figure out how they are related. For instance, humans share more genes with apes like chimps and gorillas than other animals, as much as 96%. That suggests they are our closest relatives.</p><blockquote><p> We have a common ancestor with chimpanzees </p></blockquote><p>\"Try to explain that in any other way than the fact that those relationships are based on a sequence of changes through time,\" says <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/chris-stringer.html\">Chris Stringer</a> of the Natural History Museum in London. \"We have a common ancestor with chimpanzees, and we and they have diverged since then from that common ancestor.\"</p><p>We can also use genetics to track the detail of evolutionary changes.</p><p>\"You can compare different types of bacteria and find the genes that they share,\" says <a href=\"http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/moran/\">Nancy Moran</a> at the University of Texas at Austin. \"Once you recognise these genes&hellip; you can look at how they have evolved in different kinds of populations.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5ml\"}}</p><p>When Lenski went back through his <em>E. coli</em> samples, he found that the citrate-eating bacteria had several changes to their DNA that the other bacteria didn't. These changes are called mutations.</p><blockquote><p> Lenski's E. coli show us that evolution can give organisms radically new abilities </p></blockquote><p>Some of them had happened long before the bacteria developed their new ability. \"In and of themselves, [these mutations] did not confer the ability to grow on citrate, but set the stage for subsequent mutations that then conferred that ability,\" says Lenski.</p><p>This complex chain of events helps explain why only one population evolved the ability.</p><p>It also illustrates an important point about evolution. A particular evolutionary step may seem extremely unlikely, but if there are enough organisms being pushed to take it, one of them probably will &ndash; and it only takes one.</p><p>Lenski's <em>E. coli</em> show us that evolution can give organisms radically new abilities. But evolution doesn't always make things better. Its effects are often, to our eyes at least, rather random.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5df\"}}</p><p>The mutations that lead to changes in an organism are very rarely for the better, says Moran. In fact, most mutations have either no impact, or a negative impact, on the way an organism functions.</p><blockquote><p> Animals that live in dark caves often lose their eyes </p></blockquote><p>When bacteria are confined to isolated environments, they sometimes pick up unwelcome genetic mutations that get passed on directly to every generation. Over time, this gradually hampers the species.</p><p>\"It really shows the process of evolution,\" says Moran. \"It's not all just adaptation and things getting better, there's also this big potential for things to get worse.\"</p><p>What's more, organisms sometimes lose abilities. For instance, animals that live in dark caves often lose their eyes.</p><p>This may seem odd. We tend to think of evolution as a process of biological betterment, of species improving and becoming less primitive. But this is not necessarily what happens.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5gm\"}}</p><p>The notion of betterment can be traced back to a scientist named Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was pushing the idea that organisms evolve before Darwin was. His contributions were vital.</p><blockquote><p> What did he mean they wanted to improve? How would you test that? </p></blockquote><p>But unlike Darwin, Lamarck thought that organisms got better at living in their environments as a deliberate reaction to those environments, as though they inherently wanted to improve.</p><p>Lamarck's theory would say that giraffes have long necks because their ancestors stretched to reach tall trees, and then passed their newly-acquired long necks on to their offspring.</p><p>\"Darwin wrote about Lamarck privately and said his theory is complete nonsense, it's untestable,\" says Jones. \"What did he mean they wanted to improve? How would you test that?\"</p><p>Darwin had an alternative theory: natural selection. It offers a completely different explanation for giraffes' long necks.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5nr\"}}</p><p>Imagine an ancestor of modern giraffes, something a bit like a deer or antelope. If there were lots of tall trees where this animal lived, the animals with the longest necks would get more food, and do better than those with shorter necks.</p><blockquote><p> Animals like giraffes are so striking because they appear so perfectly adapted </p></blockquote><p>After a few generations, all the animals would have slightly longer necks than their ancestors did. Again, those with the longest would do best, so over many years, giraffes' necks would gradually get longer, because those with short necks tended not to have offspring.</p><p>The mutations underlying this all happened at random, and were just as likely to produce short necks as long ones. But those short-neck mutations didn't tend to last.</p><p>Animals like giraffes are so striking because they appear so perfectly adapted. They live in areas where the trees are tall and only have leaves high off the ground, so of course they have long necks to reach them.</p><p>\"That kind of image is actually what confuses people, I think, because it looks so perfect, it looks designed,\" says Moran. But if you look closer, it is the result of a long chain of little changes. \"You realise, oh, it's not designed, it's actually one odd event that might have spread and led to another odd event.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd44d\"}}</p><p>We now have all the pieces of evidence that, when put together, show that life has evolved.</p><blockquote><p> Human evolution has always been a concept difficult for some to stomach </p></blockquote><p>Descent with modification, which is caused by random mutations in genes, ultimately leads to gradual changes and the formation of new species &ndash; much of it driven by natural selection, which weeds out those organisms that are less suited to their environments.</p><p>Finally, let's apply all this to ourselves.</p><p>Human evolution has always been a concept difficult for some to stomach, but it's impossible to turn a blind eye to it now, says Stringer.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5kt\"}}</p><p><em>Homo sapiens</em> is believed to have evolved in Africa before spreading all over the world.</p><blockquote><p> People of European and Asian descent carry Neanderthal genes in their DNA </p></blockquote><p>The fossil record shows a gradual change from ape-like animals walking on all fours to bipedal creatures that gradually developed bigger brains.</p><p>The first humans to leave Africa interbred with other hominin species, such as the Neanderthals. As a result, people of European and Asian descent carry Neanderthal genes in their DNA, but people of African descent don't.</p><p>This all happened thousands of years ago, but the story is not over. We are still evolving.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd43l\"}}</p><p>For instance, in the 1950s a British doctor called Anthony Allison was studying a genetic disorder called sickle-cell anaemia, which is common in some African populations. People with the disorder have misshapen red blood cells, which don't carry oxygen around the body as well as they might.</p><blockquote><p> For those people, it was worth carrying the sickle-cell mutation </p></blockquote><p>Allison discovered that the east African populations were divided into groups of lowland-dwelling people, who were prone to the disease, and people who lived in the highlands, who were not.</p><p>It turned out that people carrying the sickle-cell trait got an unexpected benefit. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature.2011.9342\">It protected them from malaria</a>, which was only really a threat in the lowlands. For those people, it was worth carrying the sickle-cell mutation, even if their children might be anaemic.</p><p>By contrast, people living in highland areas were not at risk from malaria. That meant there was no advantage to carrying the sickle-cell trait, so its otherwise-harmful nature had meant it disappeared.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yd5h0\"}}</p><p>Of course, there are all sorts of questions about evolution that we still haven't answered.</p><blockquote><p> Their ancestors go back in an unbroken line for over 3 billion years </p></blockquote><p>Stringer offers a simple one: what was the genetic change that allowed humans to walk upright, and why was that mutation so successful? Right now we don't know, but with more fossils and better genetics, we might someday.</p><p>What we do know is that evolution is a fact of nature. It is the basis for life on Earth as we know it.</p><p>So next time you're out and about, whether it's in your garden or on a farm or just walking down a road, take a look at the animals and plants around you and think about how they all got there.</p><p>Each of the organisms you see, whether it's a tiny insect or a great big elephant, is the latest member of an ancient family.

                            <p>Eight legs, eight eyes and a pair of venomous fangs &ndash; the average spider is so well-equipped that it's easy to see why arachnophobes are terrified. But there is one saving grace: at least spiders are solitary, so they are usually encountered in small numbers.</p><p>That's certainly what I thought.</p><p>But then I found myself trudging along a muddy path in the Peruvian Amazon jungle, face to face with a spider colony several thousand strong. Their funnel-shaped web arched from tree to tree, a structure containing too many of the creepy crawlies to count.</p><p>These were spiders but not as I knew them: they appeared to function as a society, just like ants or bees.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

Some can reach more than 25ft (7.6m) feet long and 5ft (1.5m) wide. A web that size could contain as many as 50,000 individual spiders. That is a lot of legs, eyes and fangs.</p><p><em>A. eximius</em> was first discovered more than a century ago by a French arachnologist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Simon">Eug&egrave;ne Simon</a>. More social spiders have been discovered since. One was found as recently as 2006, in Ecuador, by entomologist <a href="http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/person/laviles">Leticia Avil&eacute;s</a>.</p><p>Sociality shows up in at least seven spider families. In all we know of around 25 social species among the 45,000 described spider species on the planet. Sociality evolved at least a dozen separate times among them.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>While the details vary from species to species among the social spiders, many of their features are similar.</p><p>For example, an <em>A. eximius</em> colony contains adult males and females as well as youngsters, but the majority of spiders on the web are females. In the early 1980s, researchers found that males comprise only between 5% and 22% of any colony's populace.</p><p>Communal spiders <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3705391">work together</a> to build, maintain, and clean their webs. They cooperate in capturing prey, and dine together when they snare a large feast.</p><p>The females feed their offspring by vomiting up food for them, just like mother birds. They even regurgitate food for juveniles other than their own. In other words, they work together to care for the youngest in the colony. It is a sort of spider day-care.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

In its place, two smaller colonies are left behind.</p><blockquote><p> My students know more about social spiders than your average arachnologist </p></blockquote><p>Other times, individual females will strike out on their own, setting up a new web. Eventually other dispersing females will join the group; perhaps ones who tried to set up their own webs but failed. Survival is more likely in groups, after all.</p><p>These two processes together help to explain why <em>A. eximius</em> colonies tend to be found in clusters, sometimes as many as 40 related colonies within just a few kilometres.</p><p><em>A. eximius</em> is perhaps the best known of the social spiders, but that is not saying much.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Gregarious arachnids are not much studied &ndash; perhaps because so few of them exist in the first place. "My students know more about social spiders than your average arachnologist," says <a href="https://entomology.cals.cornell.edu/people/linda-rayor">Linda Rayor</a>, an entomologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who studies Australia's <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/huntsman-spiders">social huntsman spiders</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Why was the bee subject to such an awful fate? </p></blockquote><p>"Most animals are solitary," she tells me, "whether you're looking at mammals, or birds, or whatever. Social behaviour in otherwise solitary animals is cool."</p><p>Cool indeed, if somewhat creepy.</p><p>As I watched the social spiders go about their day deep in the jungle, a bee found itself stuck in the giant web. Suddenly, dozens of the eight-legged predators descended <em>en masse</em> onto the struggling black-and-yellow striped insect. It was impossible to see through the writhing mass of tiny spider legs, but one thing was certain: that bee was done for.</p><p>If death by one spider seems bad enough, it must be nothing compared to an attack by a whole swarm of them.</p><p>Why was the bee subject to such an awful fate? Or, to put it another way, how and why did a few spiders become social when the overwhelming majority of their fellow species are solitary?</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>The first spider, the proto-spider, was probably solitary. So the spiders that gave rise to today's truly social species must have been too. But then they did something remarkable: they turned sub-social: they learned to tolerate each other, at least for a time &ndash; even if they did not exactly enjoy hanging out in groups.</p><blockquote><p> As they mature, they become intolerant of each other </p></blockquote><p>That early tolerance could have come about as a result of parental care. In some spiders alive today, that is just defending an egg sac, but in others &ndash; the ones that are poised to evolve sociality &ndash; it looks more familiar to our mammal brains.</p><p>In those species, females provide food and protection for their developing offspring, and occasionally even to other juveniles. In some species, mothers even make the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.3699">ultimate sacrifice</a>, allowing themselves in their last moments to become a meal for their brood. Sub-social spiders can still be cannibals, after all.</p><p>"They're the spiders that already have cooperation as juveniles," says arachnologist Jonathan Pruitt of the University of California, Santa Barbara. "But as they mature, they become intolerant of each other."</p><p>In other words, juvenile tolerance alone is not enough to turn spiders fully social. The environment in which the spiders live also has to be right. Researchers have discovered three ecological elements that often lead to cooperative living among arachnids.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Social spiders tend to feed on bigger prey, for one thing.</p><p>Solitary spiders living in places where it is difficult to subdue large or more profitable prey alone may eventually figure out that it is in their interest to work together. It is a smaller step from tolerance to cooperation than from aggression to cooperation.</p><blockquote><p> Social spiders just about always build webs </p></blockquote><p>Another common feature is heavy rain. Rain does not have to be frequent, but when it is really intense, it has the potential to seriously damage spider webs. When a tempest takes out the web and threatens a spider's survival, the ones with just a glimmer of social behaviour might fare just a little better than their isolationist peers.</p><p>As a result, some have hypothesised that rough weather favours cooperation, since in those conditions it is the spiders that share the task of maintaining and repairing their webs that fare best. "Many hands make light work of web repair," says Pruitt.</p><p>Then there is the web itself. There are only a couple of instances in which spiders that do not build webs have evolved to be sub-social. These web-less social spiders, living in places like the Australian deserts or in African scrub habitat, have to cope with unusual circumstances &ndash; like enormous prey or particularly aggressive raiding ants.</p><p>But these cases aside, social spiders just about always build webs. And most of these webs have complex, three-dimensional structures, like the cone-shaped <em>A. eximius </em>webs I encountered in the jungle.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Pruitt thinks that could be a simple matter of mechanics. It is easier for two spiders just on the cusp of evolving sociality to join their webs together if they exist in three dimensions than if they weave flatter, two-dimensional ones, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_spider">Charlotte's eponymous web</a>.</p><p>Some combination of tolerance, prey size, rough weather, and web geometry combine to create the perfect storm for social behaviour to emerge in spiders.</p><blockquote><p> Anyone can do any job, and all are capable of reproduction </p></blockquote><p>Add in the fact that it is easier to defend yourself against predators in a group, and that communal webs offer spiders the relative safety of staying in one place rather than risking travelling away from the web onto which you are born to live somewhere else, and for some species, cooperation is a good deal.</p><p>These spiders, like <em>A. eximius </em>with its massive funnel pits of doom, may superficially seem to behave like social insects. But in truth they could hardly be more different.</p><p>Bees and ants sort into separate castes. Some are workers, some are soldiers (or drones), and then there is a reproductive class. Those not included in the reproductive class are sterile; they could not reproduce even if they wanted to.</p><p>Social spiders, meanwhile, are more egalitarian. Anyone can do any job, and all are capable of reproduction.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>It is not that spider societies do not rely on the division of labour. It is just that those roles are not strictly governed as they are for the social insects.</p><blockquote><p> Spider vocations are intimately tied to their efficiency at those vocations </p></blockquote><p>And while some female social spiders do not wind up reproducing, it is not because they are physically or genetically incapable. Instead, it is usually just because they have not lived successful enough lives. It takes a lot of nutrition to make a few hundred spider babies, and a spider that does not have a rich enough diet is not really up to the task.</p><p>Instead, roles in spider colonies are usually sorted on the basis of age and sex. Researchers are increasingly coming to realise that social spiders also sort themselves according to their individual personalities. "They're incredibly well organised," says Pruitt.</p><p>By paying close attention to individual spiders, he and others have discovered that certain spiders are more likely to spend their days attacking predators, while others are more likely to repair the webs, help keep parasites away, clean the web, rear the young, and so on.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>"Spider vocations are intimately tied to their efficiency at those vocations," he says.</p><blockquote><p> In spite of a lack of genetic diversity, they exhibit this exquisite diversity in terms of their personalities </p></blockquote><p>Though it is not yet clear whether those skills develop through experience or because of innate aptitude, some spiders are clearly in the construction business, some are hunters, others are on janitorial duty, and still others offer childcare services.</p><p>In species like <em>A. eximius</em>, spiders are essentially clones. Brothers and sisters mate with each other, generation after generation, so that colonies become highly inbred.</p><p>Since adolescent spiders do not go off in search of new colonies, there is no influx of new genetic material. For that reason, some suspect that spider personalities develop as a result of early life experiences, not genetics. "In spite of a lack of genetic diversity, they exhibit this exquisite diversity in terms of their personalities," Pruitt says.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>In 2013, he and his colleagues looked at a social spider called <em>Stegodyphus sarasinorum</em>, native to India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. They <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.1407">found that</a> individual personality traits predict which job each spider performs.</p><p><em>S. sarasinorum</em> is found in dry scrubland. But like the spiders I found in the rainforests of Peru, these arachnids work cooperatively to build and maintain their webs and to capture food.</p><blockquote><p> Social spiders have distinct personalities </p></blockquote><p>Using tiny dabs of paint applied to the spiders, Pruitt and his team were able to track 40 from each of two different wild colonies. Individuals that were bolder were more likely to be involved in attacking prey &ndash; but other characteristics, like body size or a spider's level of aggression, did not factor into their vocation.</p><p>"Responding to stimuli from a prey caught in the web elicits different responses according to a set of individual characteristics," they concluded.</p><p>In other words, social spiders have distinct personalities, which in turn help to define their roles in the community.</p><p>In a way, that is not so different from human societies. Bold, risk-taking people might be more likely to wind up fighting fires or enrolling in a police academy, while the more calculating, deliberative types wind up as lawyers or architects.</p><p>Despite lacking a backbone, invertebrates like insects and arachnids lend themselves well to studying complex social behaviour. "When it comes to a behaviour that any sort of animal can do, insects [and arachnids] can do it, if not do it better," says entomologist <a href="http://twitter.com/phil_torres">Phil Torres</a>.</p><p>After all, they have been evolving on our planet for a lot longer than any bird or mammal has.</p>
